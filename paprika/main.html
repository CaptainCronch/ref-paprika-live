                Paprika is a sandy lop-eared rabbit. Using they/he pronouns, Paprika is non-binary.
                Somewhat tall and lanky, they have lighter, creamier fur as countershading, as well as on their hands and forearms.
                They also have "muddy" feet. They have medium-ish length, brown to black, defined fluffy and wavy hair.
                Paprika features clawed hands and feet. Their fur is somewhat long and fluffy, and is longer where the color is lighter.
                Paprika's ears are long, droopy, and soft. They have light brown to black irises. Their tail is large and bushy, also featuring countershading.
                Paprika has slitted nostrils and no paw pads (fluffy rabbit paws).<br>

                Paprika is my first sona, made on October 17, 2022 (originally designed by scidev) to commemorate my furry acceptance.
                They started off as male, he/they, and a femboy (a lot has changed, both visually and otherwise.)
