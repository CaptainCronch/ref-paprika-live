                Capri is a red scaled (and horned) kobold. She uses her pronouns just as anyone else does.
                She is also a female girl. She is somewhat short and thin, also having a pale amber countershading (found on her front, under her chin, under her tail, on her palms, and under her feet).
                Her horns curve back, then loop around to point forward, passing by the sides of her head.
                She has claws, and a bit of spiky mouth for fun. She also has amber to black irises.
                Her tail could be considered small, compared to the average scalie tail.
                She has three large cheek frills, two red and one pale amber.<br>
                <br>
                Capri is my second sona, made on January 17, 2024 (designed by me). She started out as an NPC for my indie RPG project, Timotero,
                though she soon graduated to OC level, and eventually to full sona status (I still debate on it sometimes though).
                In the game, she was created to be the guide to the "naturalist" class, which focuses on working with nature, using items with little processing,
                and taking advantage of the environment's mechanics and resources.
